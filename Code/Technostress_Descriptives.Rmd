- Articles ranged from 2012 to 2021, which shows my meta-analysis utilizes information within 9 years of relevant data.
- Of the 127 effect sizes, 10 derived from unpublished works. 
- These articles (published and unpublished) range from 2012 to 2021, where the average year is 2018.
- The mean number of effect sizes drawn from these works $\approx$ 3.

- The effect sizes were separated by the type of latent (unobservable) variable being measured.
  - The number of relationships between technology use and anxiety = 54.
  - The number of relationships between technology use and depression = 70.
  - The remaining effect sizes were either a measure of fatigue, a combination of anxiety *and* depression, a combination of depression *and* fatigue, or a combination of anxiety *and* fatigue.
- Of those that reported the settings for observations, 64 derive from K-12 classrooms and 53 from post-secondary contexts.

- Effect sizes, or Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients ranged from $r = -.25$ to $r =.58$. The average unweighted association between measure of psychological well being and technology use is small to moderate ($r = .23$).
