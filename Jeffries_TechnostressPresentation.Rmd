## Technostress

- "A modern disease of adaptation caused by an inability to cope with new computer technologies, affecting mental health in a manner which may manifest as a struggle to accept computer technology, or as over-identification with computer technology" <sup> 1 </sup>

- "Any negative impact on attitudes, thoughts, behaviors, or body physiology that is caused either directly or indirectly by technology" <sup> 2 </sup>

- Based on the root concept of stress that includes (1) the internal state of the organism (a strain); (2) an external event (a stressor); and (3) an experience that arises from an ongoing transaction between a person and the environment. <sup> 3 </sup>

# Research Questions

"What is the relationship between technostress and social anxiety in K-12 or higher 
education?"

"What is the association between technostress and depression in K-12 or higher 
education?"

"How does the correlation between anxiety & depression and technostress differ 
depending on the user's age?"

# Past Literature

- Inclusion or exclusion criteria were too <i>narrow</i><sup> 1 </sup>
  - Only involving articles that measured social media use 
  - Excluding unpublished articles (publication bias and file drawer effect)
- A focus on technostress in professional organization, industry, employees<sup> 2 </sup>
  - Measured outcome is usually job satisfaction, performance, productivity
- Investigating relationship of age and technology <i>acceptance</i> and <i>integration</i><sup> 3 </sup>
  - Angled at examining this in educators rather than students<sup> 4 </sup>

## Data Transformation
- Pearson <i>r</i> correlation coefficients transformed into Fishers Z scores
  - Allowed for this analysis, as this provided Fishers standard errors
- Odds ratios transformed into correlations, then into Fishers Z scores
  - Standardized all odds ratios and allows for comparison across studies
- Fishers Z scores transformed back into Pearson <i>r</i> correlation coefficients

# Robust Variance Estimation Base Model
## Interpretation

Fisher's z were computed for each of the Pearson's *r* correlation coefficients and Odds Ratios drawn from these articles.
Results:
- the average weighted effect size from all effect sizes drawn from the pool of studies is 0.295
  - the average correlation coefficient is 0.287
- the magnitude of this effect size was found to be significant (p < 0.01)
- percent of variance due to between-study factors = 35.48% = <i>I^2</i>
- 1 standard deviation of the average weight effect = 0.01 = <i>Tau^2</i>
- The weighted effect size of this model is estimated to fall between [0.208, 0.382], 95% of the time
  - This corresponds to a true effect of *r* between [0.205, 0.364]
- a prediction interval of [-0.0635, 0.6535]

# Limitations

Limited *df* in meta-regression model suggests I need to reduce number of predictors
Deletion of:
- fatigue moderator
- interaction moderator

Which leaves me with:
- anxiety or depression moderators
- percent female participants
- average age
- K-12 or higher education moderators
---
class: middle, inverse

# Future Study

To alleviate the stress on the *df*, it is suggested that I have 2 separate RVE Meta-Regressions that involve
- anxiety or depression, average age, and percent female moderators
- K-12 or higher education, average age, and percent female moderators

Investigating those that identified as multi- or bi-racial. The correlation between this moderator and correlation effect sizes was 0.77!
- Likely very limited studies that recognize this group

I also plan to include more studies in my article pool to bolster my findings. As of now, I have 29 articles to screen for inclusion from forward/backward citation searching.
